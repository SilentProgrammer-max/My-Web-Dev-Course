            <h2>What is AI?</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence. These tasks include understanding language, recognizing images, making decisions, and solving problems. AI aims to build machines that can think, learn, and adapt like humans. AI technologies are used in many areas such as healthcare for diagnosing diseases, finance for detecting fraud, autonomous vehicles, virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, and much more. AI systems improve continuously by learning from data, making them smarter and more efficient over time.</p>

            <h2>What is ML and DL?</h2>
            <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where computers learn from data to improve their performance on specific tasks without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms find patterns in data and use these patterns to make predictions or decisions. There are different types of ML such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Deep Learning (DL) is a more advanced form of ML that uses artificial neural networks with many layers. These deep networks can analyze complex data like images, audio, and text, enabling applications like facial recognition, speech translation, and self-driving cars with high accuracy.

    <h2>More About AI</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on building machines and software that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, natural language understanding, perception, and decision making. AI can be achieved using various approaches including rule-based systems and data-driven learning methods. Machine Learning (ML) is a major subset of AI where machines improve their performance by learning from data instead of following explicit instructions. ML algorithms analyze data to detect patterns and make predictions or decisions based on new data. This includes supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding hidden patterns in data), and reinforcement learning (learning by trial and error with feedback).

Deep Learning (DL) is a specialized part of ML that uses deep neural networks composed of multiple layers to model and understand highly complex data. These networks are inspired by the human brainâ€™s structure and are particularly good at handling unstructured data like images, speech, and text. DL has powered many AI breakthroughs such as voice assistants (e.g., Alexa, Google Assistant), real-time language translation, autonomous driving, and medical image analysis.

Together, these fields form a hierarchy: AI is the overall goal of creating intelligent machines; ML is one way to achieve AI by learning from data; DL is a powerful subset of ML that enables solving complex problems with huge amounts of data. AI, ML, and DL continue to revolutionize industries by automating tasks, improving decision-making, and enabling new technologies that were once thought impossible.</p>
